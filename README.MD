# Electro Optics engineering using ATLAS Silvaco TCAD
Here i share some of my projects in a Master reaserch and project based class in Electro-optics.\
In this class i desined multiple electronic and optoelectroncis devices using ATLAS Language, which is\
almost lile MATLAB, with a little different syntax.
In each project i will provide some basic background.
