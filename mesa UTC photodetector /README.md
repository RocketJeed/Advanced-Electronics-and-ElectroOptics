# Mesa UTC photodetector 

# Intro
A photoconductor is a device whose resistance and conductivity changes in the presence of light. Most modern photodetectors operate on the basis of the internal photoelectric effect, where the photoexcited electrons and holes remain within the material, increasing the electrical conductivity of the material which use for Terahertz communication and other applications.

# Design specs
Construct an Atlas model for a mesa UTC photodetector and please find :
I-V curve (reverse, forward biased) without light \
PD impulse response when biased at -3 volt. To mitigate nonlinear effect, use small optical input \
Frequency response of the PD

# Results 

The x, y composition for lattice matched 1.1Q and 1.4Q\
(google search or use atlas manual find equations for the InGaAsP bandgap,then do some sample matlab program)
